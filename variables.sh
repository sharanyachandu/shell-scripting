#/bin/bash
#In bash their is no concept of variable declaRATION LIKE INT,FLOAT,string
#varibles can be declared using $ ex echo $a
#echo $a
#echo ${a}
#echo "$a"
a=10
b=7
echo ${b}
echo "$a"
echo $b
#if we are not giving specific value it will not show any difference
#ex
 echo "value of $d"
 if we want to give value in linux command we can use emport command
 #ex export varable="value"(in command line)
 #NOTE:But this value can be used for one time.i.e,if we restart the server yhis value will not be shown
